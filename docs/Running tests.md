## E2E Tests

The aim of this test suite is perform end to end tests, simulating a user flow.

# e2e test Docker stack setup

End to end tests requires the following docker setup:

- Latest/Release Tagged API image (stored in GCR)
- Elasticsearch
- Redis
- Postgres DB using a UAT DB snapshot (stored in GCR)
- Caseworker/Exporter (built from code)

- Copy environment variables (make sure to save your current .env files before running the below):
```
cp ci.caseworker.env caseworker.env
cp ci.exporter.env exporter.env
cp ci.api.env api.env
```
- Fill the env files with appropriate values from Vault. Including vars with export statements.

```

export AUTHBROKER_CLIENT_SECRET=
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_REGION=

```

### Caseworker Setup and run tests locally

- Open a terminal, source both api.env and caseworker.env. This will ensure all export statements are run and appropriate env vars are set and ready for docker-compose.
- run `make start-caseworker`
- Wait for it to start up. Open another terminal and run `make caseworker-e2e-selenium-test`

### Exporter Setup and run tests locally

- Open a terminal, source both api.env and exporter.env. This will ensure env vars are ready for docker-compose.
- run `make start-exporter`
- Wait for it to start up. Open another terminal and run `make exporter-e2e-selenium-test`


### Running automated tests before production release
Jenkins job `lite-frontend-ui-tests` is designed to run both caseworker and exporter tests on demand for specific release tags or branches.

First step is to make sure the `lite-api` image is tagged correctly in GCR. A GCR trigger builds image upon preparing git release. But, until fixed, it won't be tagging that image with correct release tag. This must be done manually using GCR console. As soon as git release process is done on Github, head to triggered builds [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/sre-docker-registry/global/github.com/uktrade/lite-api). And tag the latest built image with the release tag (v1.34.0 for ex).

Once tagging is done, open Jenkins [job](https://jenkins.ci.uktrade.digital/view/LITE/job/lite-frontend-ui-tests/) >> Build with parameters >> select correct release tag for FE and API as you would do with UAT/Production release >> let it run the tests. You can see the tests running [here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/uktrade/lite-frontend?filter=all) in CircleCI.

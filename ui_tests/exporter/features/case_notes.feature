  Scenario: view a case note added by caseworker
    Given I signin and go to exporter homepage and choose Test Org
    And I submit an application with <name>,<product>,<clc_rating>,<end_user_name>,<end_user_address>,<consignee_name>,<consignee_address>,<country>,<end_use>,<is_mod_security_approved>

    When I go to exporter homepage
    Then I see a notification next to check progress
    When I click check progress
    Then I see a notification next to the application
    When I click on my application

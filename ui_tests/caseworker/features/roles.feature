  I want to create roles with permissions
  So that I can restrict access to functionality

  Scenario: Edit a role
    Given I sign in as Test UAT user
    When I go to users
    And I go to manage roles
    And I add a new role called "Supervisor" with permission to "Manage licence final advice" and set status to "Closed"
    And I edit my role
    Then I see the role in the roles list

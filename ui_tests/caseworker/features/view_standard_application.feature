Feature: I want to view the case details of a case
  As a Logged in government user
  I want to view the details on a case
  So that I can make review the case before making any decisions

  Scenario: Gov user can see case details
    Given I sign in to SSO or am signed into SSO
    And I create an application with <name>,<product>,<part_number>,<clc_rating>,<end_user_name>,<end_user_address>,<consignee_name>,<consignee_address>,<country>,<end_use>
    And the status is set to "submitted"
    When I go to the case list page
    And I click on show filters
    And I filter by application type "Standard Individual Export Licence"
    Then I should see my case in the cases list
    When I go to application previously created
    Then I should see the product name as "Rifle" with product rating as "PL9002"
    And the "Consignee" name is "Automated Consignee", address is "1234, Trade centre", country is "Belgium"
    And the "End user" name is "Automated End user", address is "1234, High street", country is "Belgium"

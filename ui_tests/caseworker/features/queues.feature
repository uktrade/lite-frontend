@all @internal @queues
Feature: I want to define new work queues and the teams they belong to
  As a logged in government user
  I want to be able to define new work queues and the department they belong to
  So that new government departments and teams within departments which require their own work queues can easily have one


  Scenario: Cases that reached terminal status are not on any queue (appear in All cases queue)
    Given I sign in to SSO or am signed into SSO
    And I create standard application or standard application has been previously created
    When I go to application previously created
    And I assign myself to the case
    And I click change status
    And I select status "Withdrawn" and save
    And I go to the internal homepage
    And I click on the "All cases" queue in dropdown
    Then I see previously created application


@all @internal @queues
Feature: I want to view all cases ready to review
  As a logged in government user
  I want to see how many open cases there are
  So that I can quickly make an assessement

  Scenario: Go to work queue
    Given I sign in to SSO or am signed into SSO
    When I go to the internal homepage
    Then I see the all cases tab
    And I see the open queries tab
    And I see the my cases tab

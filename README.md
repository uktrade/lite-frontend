**Frontend for LITE - the Department for International Trade (DIT)**

---

## Development

### Requirements

- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-37/)
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

### Installing

    $ git clone https://github.com/uktrade/lite-frontend
    $ cd lite-frontend
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
    $ pipenv install --dev

#### Git Hub pre-commit setup
- Install pre-commit (e.g MAC pip install pre-commit)
- pre-commit install
* run following to scan all files for issues
  - pre-commit run --all-files

### Configuration

Secrets such as API keys and environment specific configurations are placed in `caseworker.env` and `exporter.env` - a file that is not added to version control. To create a template secrets file with dummy values run:

```
make secrets
```

### Commands

To run the webserver for caseworker and exporter use these commands:

```
make run_caseworker
make run_exporter
```

### Running with Docker

- Download the repository:

  - `git clone https://github.com/uktrade/lite-frontend.git`
  - `cd lite-frontend`

#### First time setup

  - Set up your local config file:
    - `make secrets`
    - populate the newly created `caseworker.env` and `exporter.env` with values from Vault.

  * Ensure docker is running

  * Build and start docker images:
    - If you haven't already done this for lite-api, set up a shared docker network:
      - `docker network create lite` - shared network to allow API and frontend to communicate
    - `docker-compose build` - build the container image
  * Installation requirements
    - install libmagic

#### Starting the service
- `docker-compose up -d` - to start the two frontend Django servers

- Ensure you have a working version of `lite-api` running, see [the instructions for running it
  in docker](https://github.com/uktrade/lite-api/blob/master/README.md#running-the-service-with-docker)

- Visit:
    - [http://localhost:8200](http://localhost:8200) for the caseworker frontend
    - [http://localhost:8300](http://localhost:8300) for the exporter frontend

#### Running unit tests

To run unit tests:

```
make run_unit_tests_caseworker
make run_unit_tests_exporter
make run_unit_tests_core
make run_all_unit_tests
```

## UI tests

We use pytest + Selenium for end-to-end tests.

Run all tests

```
PIPENV_DOTENV_LOCATION=exporter.env ENVIRONMENT=local pipenv run pytest ui_tests/
make run_ui_tests
```
Run all Unit and UI tests
```
make run_all_tests
```


> You can use the flags `--step-through` (in conjunction with `-s`) and `--step-verbose` to stop on each step. Helpful for exploration and debugging.

> The UI tests (a.k.a. end-to-end tests, e2e tests, browser tests or functional tests) require some local configuration
changes before they can run. As mentioned above, you need to run `make run_caseworker` and `make run_exporter`.
These copy the `example.caseworker.env` and `example.exporter.env` files to `caseworker.env` and `exporter.env`
respectively. In each file, the following variables need to have different values (see development team members for
what those values should be or just try looking in Vault):

* AUTHBROKER_CLIENT_ID
* AUTHBROKER_CLIENT_SECRET
* AUTHBROKER_URL - should be https://sso.trade.uat.uktrade.io for caseworker but https://great.uat.uktrade.digital
  for the exporter
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
* AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
* AWS_REGION
* TEST_SSO_EMAIL
* TEST_SSO_PASSWORD
* TEST_SSO_NAME (for the caseworker)
* NOTIFY_KEY
* NOTIFY_FEEDBACK_TEMPLATE_ID
* NOTIFY_FEEDBACK_EMAIL
* ENVIRONMENT - set to "local" if the tests are targeting the local caseworker
  and exporter. If not set the UI tests will try talking to devdata
* DIRECTORY_SSO_API_CLIENT_BASE_URL - Needed by the UI tests but not the caseworker or exporter, available
  in Vault
* DIRECTORY_SSO_API_CLIENT_API_KEY - Needed by the UI tests but not the caseworker or exporter, available
  in Vault

Before running the UI tests, make sure you have the following services running with corresponding ports:

* lite-api (port=**8100**)
* casework (port=**8200**)
* exporter (port=**8300**)

An example for how to run the above service:

```bash
cd lite-api
PIPENV_DOTENV_LOCATION=.env pipenv run python ./manage.py runserver 8100
cd ../lite-frontend
PIPENV_DOTENV_LOCATION=caseworker.env pipenv run python ./manage.py runserver 8200
PIPENV_DOTENV_LOCATION=exporter.env pipenv run python ./manage.py runserver 8300
```

You will also need to seed the lite-api database with the TEST_SSO_EMAIL (as well as running **seedall**
command - see https://github.com/uktrade/lite-api). If the email was `fake@fake.com` the
command would be (run against the lite-api virtual environment):

```bash
INTERNAL_USERS='[{"email"=>"fake@fake.com"}]' ./manage.py seedinternalusers
```

Finally, to run a UI test on the command line (will run an exporter and caseworker test tagged with `@run_this_test`):

```bash
PIPENV_DOTENV_LOCATION=exporter.env ENVIRONMENT=local pipenv run pytest -m "run_this_test" ui_tests/exporter
PIPENV_DOTENV_LOCATION=caseworker.env ENVIRONMENT=local pipenv run pytest -m "run_this_test" ui_tests/caseworker/
```

<p class="govuk-body">
    The grading can sometimes include a prefix and suffix. There are many in use and so it is important that you know
    the full classification of the product.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
    If the product was developed with Ministry of Defence (MOD) funding you will find the grading in the Security
    Aspects Letter provided by the MOD project team.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If the product was developed with overseas government support, that government is responsible for
    providing the grading.</p>

<div class="govuk-body">If the product was developed without UK or overseas government support, you should apply for a
    private venture grading using <a class="govuk-link" target="_blank"
        href="https://www.spire.trade.gov.uk/">SPIRE â€“ the online export licensing system</a>
        . The grading will be provided by MOD.

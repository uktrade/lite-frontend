		Most documents generated by DBT are digitally signed. This allows exporters to ensure that the documents they download and view are authentic.
		<br><br>Digitally signed documents will have a signature on the last page.
		<br><br>In order to ensure that documents you download and view are authentic, do the following;
		<br>
		<ol>
			<li>Download the certificate from the link below</li>
			<li>Import this into your Adobe Reader\'s "trusted certificates" </li>
			<li>Ensure the certificate is set as a trusted root for certifying documents</li>
		</ol>
		<br>After this, whenever you view a signed DBT document from this site, you will see a banner indicating that the document has come from a trusted source.

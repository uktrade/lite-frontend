# The mock sso here implements a barebones OAuth flow.
#
# The Authorize endpoint will return an access code which can then be used to
# retrieve an access token from the Token endpoint.
# The Token endpoint will then return an access token that can be used in
# requests to the APIUserMe to get details about the user.
#
# In the Authorize endpoint we work out the user that we want to login in.
# This is provided either by being explicitly set in settings or by displaying
# a login form.
# We then store this email in the cache paired with the access code.
#
# When the access code is then swapped for an access token we can retrieve the
# paired email address from the cache and then generate an access token paired
# to the same email address.
#
# This access token can then be used to retrieve details about the user and it
# will return the same email address that was set in the initial Authorize call.
#
# This is copying exactly how an OAuth flow would work for real without any real
# authorisation and most importantly allows us to login as any user by supplying
# the email address via a login prompt displayed when a user tries to login.
#
# NOTE: THIS IS ONLY FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PURPOSES.
